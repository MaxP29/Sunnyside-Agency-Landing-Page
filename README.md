### Continued development

In future projects i want to focus on making the Media Queries shorter by scaling down the font-size in % and the making the alterations to margins and other design features rather than adjusting everything like I did in this project. I am pleased with how this project turned out and the transitions i implimented, and im looking forward to improving in my next project.
